  <h1>Poem 61) Birthday Ruminations – 16th June 2020<br>written by Stella Nyanzi</h1>

  <p>
    Today is my birthday! I turn <input type="text" placeholder="your age" /> years old. I have a few more <input type="text" placeholder="noun/object/adjective" /> in my <input type="text" placeholder="body part" />. I am finally proud that my <input type="text" placeholder="what your body does" />. The <input type="text" placeholder="what’s on your skin" /> inspires wise sayings that I dish out freely to any who cares to listen. And I still <input type="text" placeholder="what your body does" />. Yeah; let's blow apart that myth that <input type="text" placeholder="what someone said" /> by <input type="text" placeholder="your age" />.
  </p>

  <p>
    My <input type="text" placeholder="your age last year" /> year was perhaps the most <input type="text" placeholder="adjective" /> year of life. I gained <input type="text" /> and lost <input type="text" />. The losses, I choose to <input type="text" />. The gains, I <input type="text" /> boldly and publicly.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was charged for two crimes against <input type="text" placeholder="president's name" />, tried, found guilty of one crime and not guilty of another, convicted, sentenced, processed as an appellant, and acquitted. I spent most of the year detained in maximum security prison where I shook the system. I left my writings scratched deep into the walls of the solitary confinement cells in the Condemned Section of <input type="text" placeholder="local prison" />.
  </p>

  <p>
    I won the civil case in which I earlier sued the government of <input type="text" placeholder="your country" /> for slapping me with a travel ban. Court lifted the travel ban and awarded me damages worth fifty million <input type="text" placeholder="currency" />. I look forward to airports reopening so that I can test whether or not my name was removed from the nasty No Fly List.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also won <input type="text" placeholder="local university" /> in a court case where I sued them for refusing to enforce the orders of the university appeals tribunal — namely to reinstate my job, pay all my dues, and promote me. Court awarded me one hundred and twenty million <input type="text" placeholder="currency" />, and ordered the university to comply with the earlier orders of the tribunal.
  </p>

  <p>
    I received several awards of recognition for my <input type="text" placeholder="your talent" />, human rights activism and scholarship. I received support from many friends and <input type="text" placeholder="group/people" />, some known to me in person and many unknown to me physically. My <input type="text" placeholder="those you love" /> were <input type="text" placeholder="verb" /> and <input type="text" placeholder="verb" /> by a huge throng of people, assuring me that even when I die, they will continue to be loved.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the <input type="text" placeholder="noun" /> are busy preparing me a birthday meal fit for a <input type="text" placeholder="royalty title" />, I am converting my bedroom into a base for my forthcoming political campaign. I am starting my <input type="text" placeholder="your age" /> year of life with a bang. I am <input type="text" placeholder="verb" /> for the <input type="text" placeholder="event/goal" /> and taking a <input type="text" placeholder="noun/action" /> into the unknown.
